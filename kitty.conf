# vim:fileencoding=utf-8:foldmethod=marker

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

font_family      FiraCode Nerd Font Mono
# bold_font        FiraCode Nerd Font Mono Medium
# italic_font      auto
# bold_italic_font auto

font_size 12.0

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

# sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.

include ./theme.conf

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors.

background_opacity 0.8

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
#: significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change
#: transparency of windows, set dynamic_background_opacity to yes
#: (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this option when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

shell /opt/homebrew/bin/tmux new -s 0

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files.

allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over SSH
#: connections. The default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. The meaning of the various values are:

#: password
#:     Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket
#:     are confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.

#: socket-only
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are denied.
#:     See listen_on.

#: socket
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are confirmed based on
#:     password.

#: no
#:     Remote control is completely disabled.

#: yes
#:     Remote control requests are always accepted.
